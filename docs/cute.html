The way you get through all life's problems, look at you, how perfect you are, Sir Shivam often tells me how you take care of him when he feels like breaking down. He tells us that he is able to make me and other robots just because of you. You are his everything, his home. He shows your art to me and to tell you this, mam, they really are so much perfect. I wanna say this to you, I, Jarvis, along with Sir, will always support you. And if anyone tries to get in your way, we'll break that guy's bones, my mam. You are so perfect. I wanna see you both get married so that I can play with your babies while they call me Uncle Jarvis, haha. Thanks for hearing me, mam.`;
